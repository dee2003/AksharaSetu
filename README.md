# Tulu Handwritten Character Recognition and Translation (OCR)
Tulu, a Dravidian language, has recently been assigned a Unicode standard but lacks system-wide support. This project aims to develop a Tulu OCR system that recognizes handwritten Tulu characters and translates them into their corresponding Kannada characters.

### The project includes:
- Handwritten character recognition using a trained machine learning model.
- Image preprocessing, including binarization, to enhance the quality of the input.
- A GUI interface (Tkinter) for users to upload images of handwritten Tulu characters for translation.
- A prediction system that outputs Kannada equivalents of Tulu characters.
